# Objective
ClimateWins is a nonprofit looking to predict future extreme weather events in main land Europe using ML methods. Climate data is taken from 18 stations across Europe starting in the 1800's to 2022. 

# Methods

Both supervised and unsupervised machine learning was done on two data sets. One containing weather information such as cloud cover and the other containing personal opinions on whether the day was pleasent or not. 

## Supervised Machine learning was done using
Opitimization through the Gradient Descent method

Three supervised ML methods were researched: KNN (K-nearst nieghbor), Decision tree, and ANN (artificial neural network)

## Unsupervised Machine Learning was done using

Hierarchical Clustering, Random Forest, GAN (General Adversarial Network), CNN (Convolution Nueral Network), and RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks)

# Goals

Predicting extreme weather events further in advance 

Determine the safety of all regions in mainland Europe

Project the next 50 years of weather conditions in mainland Europe
